<p>Human interactions are deeply influenced by emotions rather than pure rationality, especially in
job interviews. For example, consider two candidates: a beautiful young woman with minimal 
experience but a willingness to learn,and a less attractive woman who is highly qualified.
</p>
<p>Candidate 1: The Beautiful Girl</p>

<p>Her striking appearance creates a positive emotional bias in the interviewer.Despite her limited 
knowledge,her beauty may lead the interviewer to perceive her as more capable and overlook her 
lack of expertise.Her willingness to learn is seen more favorably due to this initial bias.
</p>

<p>Candidate 2: The Less Attractive Girl</p>

<p>Her qualifications are solid, but her less conventional appearance might provoke unconscious
biases from the interviewer. This emotional reaction could lead to her skills being undervalued, 
despite her suitability for the role.
</p>

<p>In both cases, emotional biases influence the interviewer's judgment, showing how feelings can often
 overshadow objective assessments of competence and experience.
